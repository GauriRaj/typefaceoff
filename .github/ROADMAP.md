# Typefaceoff Development Roadmap

## ðŸ‘‹ Context

This living document serves to plainly lay out features that are actively being worked on, planned, or under review.

Everyone is welcome to peruse and contribute to our [issues](https://github.com/typefaceoff/typefaceoff/issues). If thereâ€™s something you think would be a good addition to Typefaceoff, but it isnâ€™t mentioned here, we encourage you to open a new issue. (If you arenâ€™t sure how to go about that, no worriesâ€”check out our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/typefaceoff/typefaceoff/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).)

## ðŸ§¹ Housekeeping

Minor bug fixes and enhancements to existing features donâ€™t need to be mentioned here! This roadmap is about the big picture.
