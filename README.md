# Typefaceoff

Typefaceoff is a a drag-and-drop tool for proofing and comparing typefaces in a browser.

The tool works locally; font files are not uploaded to any server.

## Development

This project uses React for Front-end, Vanilla CSS for styling, and Vite for server tooling.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 16+ is recommended for development as anything less has yet to be tested.
The package manager of choice is pnpm instead of npm or yarn. Installation instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).
The following commands should enable you to set up a development server running of the website.

```sh
# clone your fork of the git repository and open it
cd typefaceoff
# install dependencies with pnpm (see docs if not installed https://pnpm.io/installation)
pnpm install
# set up pre-commit hooks for formatting
pnpm run husky
# start the dev server
pnpm run dev
```

Additionally, the following commands are provided:

```sh
# Build for production
npm run build
# Locally preview the production build
